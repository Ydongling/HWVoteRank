## HWVoteRank: a network-based voting approach for identifying coding and non-coding cancer drivers

- [code]: source code of HWVoteRank for the following four cases in the paper.
     - [HWVoteRank_cancer_driver_script.py]: source code for identifying coding and non-coding cancer drivers.
     - [HWVoteRank_go_enrichment_analysis.py]: source code for go enrichment analysis of coding gene without mutations.
     - [HWVoteRank_emt_script.py]: source code for identifying drivers during Epithelial-Mesenchymal transition.
     - [HWVoteRank_cancer_subtype_script.py]: source code for identifying drivers for cancer subtype.
	 

The code in our paper is inspired by the code developed by Chaudhary et al, which can be found at https://github.com/mandarsc/NIBNA.
